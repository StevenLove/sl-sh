# slvm

Simple Lisp Byte Code VM

This is intended to be a byte code virtual machine for the sl-sh shell https://github.com/sstanfield/slsh .
Currently a work in progress.  When done might be useful as a VM for other
small lisp interpreters.

It is also very loosely based on the VM from https://craftinginterpreters.com/ .
This is just the VM and is for a lisp so will not include a full language but
may get an assembler and very crude lisp (think a lisp assembly) for testing
purposes.  Eventually sl-sh will have a compiler for it.
